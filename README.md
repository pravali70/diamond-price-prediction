# 💎 Diamond Price Prediction - Mini Project
👋 Welcome to this machine learning project focused on predicting the price of diamonds using regression models!

## 📝 Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset containing detailed physical and qualitative attributes of diamonds, such as:

Carat

Cut

Color

Clarity

Depth, Table, and Dimensions (x, y, z)

The goal is to build a complete machine learning pipeline—from data exploration and preprocessing to model building and evaluation—to predict the price of a diamond based on its characteristics.

## 🎯 Objective
The primary objective is to develop and compare multiple regression models to accurately predict diamond prices. This model can assist:

Jewelers in real-time pricing

Online retailers in dynamic price display

Appraisal professionals in assessing fair value

Customers in comparing diamond options with confidence

## 🤖 Models Evaluated
We implemented and evaluated the following regression algorithms:

Linear Regression

Polynomial Regression

Support Vector Regression (SVR)

Random Forest Regressor

Tuned Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

These models help capture both linear and complex nonlinear relationships between diamond features and their market value.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
To assess model performance, the following regression metrics are used:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error) – Measures average error in price prediction

MSE (Mean Squared Error) – Penalizes larger errors

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) – Gives error in the same unit as price (e.g., dollars)

These metrics help evaluate the accuracy, reliability, and robustness of each model.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
This project is built using Python and utilizes:

pandas – Data manipulation

numpy – Numerical calculations

matplotlib & seaborn – Data visualization

scikit-learn – Regression models, preprocessing, and evaluation

xgboost – Gradient boosting for high-performance regression

scipy – For tuning and optimization

## ✅ Outcome
By comparing model performance, we aim to:

Identify the best-performing regression model for price prediction

Understand the importance of features like carat, cut, color, and clarity

Provide data-driven insights for diamond pricing strategies in retail and valuation

Build a reliable tool for dynamic pricing and inventory management

💡 Thanks for checking out this project! It highlights how data science can bring transparency, consistency, and intelligence to luxury product pricing.
